##This guide will help you to setup tomcat on EC2 and deploy a sample.war package on the server##

Step 1 : Launch an EC2 instance. You can choose your AMI. I am using "Amazon Linux AMI". Login to the instance.

Make sure you have installed java on the ec2 instance. If not, run the below command to install java.

    yum install java -y

Once installation is done, you can verify the installation by running the below command.

    java -version

Step 2 : Download tomcat from the following URL : https://mirrors.estointernet.in/apache/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.53/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.53.tar.gz
I am using tomcat version 8. You can run the below command to download the tomcat to your instance.

    Wget https://mirrors.estointernet.in/apache/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.53/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.53.tar.gz

Step 3 : Untar the downloaded files. You can run the below command.

    tar -xzf apache-tomcat-8.5.53.tar.gz. This will untar the file.

Step 4 : Rename the folder to tomcat. Run the below command.

    mv apache-tomcat-8.5.53 tomcat

Step 5 : Move the folder to /usr/local. This step is optional but recommended. Run the below command.

    cp tomcat /usr/local/

Step 6 : Go to the tomcat folder and change your location to webapps. Download the sample.war file to this location. You can download the war file from the below url.

    https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/appdev/sample/sample.war. You can run the below command to download to the instance.

    wget https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/appdev/sample/sample.war

Step 7 : Go to the bin location in the tomcat folder. Run the below command.

    ./catalina.sh start : This will start the tomcat server and it should be running on port number 8080. 

Make sure you open the port in the security group.

Step 8 : Go to the browser and access the following :

    ipaddress:8080/sample

You should be able to see the sample war file running in the tomcat server.
